#   Objective
#   ---------
#
#   Use the following algorithm to calculate the nth number in the fibonacci
#   sequence. Inputs will be from 1 to 10. Input of 1 should return 0, input of
#   2 should return 1, input of 3 should return 1, input of 4 should return 2,
#   input of 5 should return 3, and so on.
#
#   procedure fib(argument: n)
#     return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)
#
#   You must use this assignment. Yes, I know every caution you've been given
#   to NEVER use such an algorithm. This is an exercise in understanding
#   recursion and calling procedures in assembly language.
#
#   If you use a loop or an equivalent to a case/switch table, your score on
#   the assignment will be 20/100.
#
#   Requirements and Specifications
#   -------------------------------
#
#   Your input cannot be stored as a global variable at any point. This means
#   you cannot store it at a data section address, even when accepting them
#   from scanf; they must be returned from scanf on the stack.
#
#   X19-X27 are global variables. You may not use X19-X27 in your recursive
#   function. If you want, you may use X19-X27 in your main function. You can
#   use any registers you want to in your main function.
#
#   A recursion procedure requires:
#
#   - Allocate stack space
#   - Save the return address and argument on the stack
#   - Recursively call procedure with BL
#   - Unwind the stack by restoring the return address and arguments and deallocating stack memory
#
#   If the code is not recursive, i.e. uses a loop or a the equivalent of a
#   case/switch table, your score will be 20/100.
#
#   Hints and Warnings
#   ------------------
#
#   You must put the local values and return address on the stack before any bl
#   call, and restore the argument and the return address after the bl call.
#
#   If you copy code from any source, e.g. friend, ai tool, stack overflow,
#   this is an honor code violation and you will fail the class.
#
#   Warning:
#   - The use of C/C++ functions except for printf and scanf is strictly prohibited.
#   - The use of automated tools (e.g. GCC compiler) to turn C code into ARM is strictly prohibited.
#   - Copy pasting code from any source is an honor code violation and will result in failing the class
